Define the time per digit in the TPulseDigit.  This needs to match the
value in the databases, and is used to plot hits versus digits.

< eventDisplay.digitization.step = 500 ns >

Define the offset from zero used in the calibration.

< eventDisplay.digitization.offset = 0 ns >

Define the rough conversion between charge and energy.  The units are
energy per charge in eV/(collected electron).

< eventDisplay.fits.energyPerCharge = 34.1 eV >
